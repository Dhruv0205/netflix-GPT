import React from "react";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

//because of strict mode sometimes react will render twice to check inconsistency if than it will throw error, if u want 1 time than remove strict mode but it will only happen in development mode(local server), if you build for production it will not happen twice
// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
